# Text to display in the banner
banner_text="This utility will go through all Rancher users and perform an Active Directory lookup using
the configured service account to get the user's distinguished name.  Next, it will perform lookups inside Rancher
for all the user's Tokens, ClusterRoleTemplateBindings, and ProjectRoleTemplateBindings.  If any of those objects,
including the user object itself are referencing a principalID based on the GUID of that user, those objects will be
updated to reference the distinguished name-based principalID (unless the utility is run with -dry-run, in that case
the only results are log messages indicating the changes that would be made by a run without that flag).

This utility will also detect and correct the case where a single ActiveDirectory GUID is mapped to multiple Rancher
users.  That condition was likely caused by a race in the original migration to use GUIDs and resulted in a second
Rancher user being created.  This caused Rancher logins to fail for the duplicated user.  The utility remedies
that situation by mapping any tokens and bindings to the original user before removing the newer user, which was
created in error.

It is also important to note that migration of ClusterRoleTemplateBindings and ProjectRoleTemplateBindings require
a delete/create operation rather than an update.  This will result in new object names for the migrated bindings.
A label with the former object name will be included in the migrated bindings.

It is recommended that you perform a Rancher backup prior to running this utility."
